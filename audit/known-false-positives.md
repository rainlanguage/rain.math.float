## Equivalent mutants: `div` `exponentB` guard boundary

`src/lib/implementation/LibDecimalFloatImplementation.sol`, `div`'s spill
branch. Changing `exponentB <= type(int256).max - adjustExponent` to `<` only
changes the outcome at `exponentB == type(int256).max - adjustExponent`, where
`underflowExponentBy` is `type(int256).max`, so the original returns the
`underflowExponentBy > 76` zero `(0, 0)`, the same as the mutant. No test can
distinguish them.

Changing it to `<= type(int256).max - adjustExponent - 1` changes the outcome
only at the same `exponentB`, where the mutant returns `(0, 0)` directly and the
original returns the same `(0, 0)` through `underflowExponentBy > 76`. The
comparison is free at its boundary in both directions.

## Equivalent mutant: `.gas-snapshot` fuzz statistics

`.gas-snapshot`, observed through
`script/check-gas-snapshot.sh <committed> <fresh>`. Changing a committed fuzz
row's statistics,
`LibDecimalFloatAbsTest:testAbsNegative(int256,int32) (runs: 5096, μ: 2577, ~: 2838)`
to `(runs: 5096, μ: 9999, ~: 2838)`, cannot change the verdict. The verdict is a
function of `normalise(committed)` and `normalise(fresh)` alone, where
`normalise` rewrites every line ending in `(runs: N, μ: X, ~: Y)` to end in
`(fuzz)`. The original and the mutated file differ only in the `μ` field of one
such line, so `normalise` maps both to the same text, and for every fresh
snapshot the two give the same verdict. Fuzz rows comparing by name only is the
check's specified behaviour: fuzz gas is not reproducible across machines even
with a fixed seed.
